# Balance Checker

##Description
> I work remotely for the most part, but on days where I go to the office I usually take public transit (UTA Frontrunner). 
To help me keep track of the balance on my public transit card, I wrote this code to scrape my card balance from 
the UTA website, and then send me updates via slack.
